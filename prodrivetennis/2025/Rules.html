        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-white text-center">Match Format and Scoring System</h2>
        <ul>
        	<li>- <b>Match Format:</b> All matches are best two out of three sets.</li>
            <li>- <b>Scoring - Points:</b> Points are scored as 15, 30, 40, Game.</li>
            <li>- <b>Scoring - Games:</b> A player must win at least four points and have a two-point lead to win a game (e.g., 40-advantage, then next point wins).</li>
            <li>- <b>Scoring - Sets:</b> To win a set, a player must win at least six games and have a two-game lead (e.g., 6-4).</li>
            <li>- <b>Set Tie-break:</b> If a set reaches a score of 6-6, a standard tie-break will be played. The first player to reach seven points with a two-point lead wins the tie-break and the set (e.g., 7-6).</li>
            <li>- <b>Match Tie-break (Super Set / Third Set Option):</b>
              <ul>
                <li>-- If the match score reaches one set all (1-1), a super tie-break (first to 10 points with a two-point lead) will be played to determine the match winner.</li>
                <li>
                -- However, if both teams mutually agree to play a full third set, the standard set scoring practice (first to six games with a two-game lead, with a tie-break at 6-6) will apply for that third set.</li>
              </ul>
			</li>
